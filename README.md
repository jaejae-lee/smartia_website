This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Smart factory web application 

This is the project for company SMARTIA.
as a UX Engineer candidate, planned UX/UI and built a demo site of the web application using React.js.

View the live demo site here: https://jaejae-lee.github.io/smartia_website

## How to set up 

NPM and a Command Line tool is needed.<br/>
`git clone this repo and cd into the project folder`<br/>
`run npm install`<br/>
`run npm start to view on localhost:3000 on browser`<br/>

## Target users 
Workers in a smart factory : <br/>
* Non gender specific, varied age (likely 30-40s) and ethnicity
* Average technical/computing skills
* Familiarity with factory assets, environment, data
* Use the app for specific purposes - they know what they are looking for

## Main expected functionalities in users voice

* We would like to monitor the site.
* We would like to monitor the factory and machine data and analyse it
* We would like get alerts for any unusual behaviour of the machines or incidents to prevent potential risks 
* We would like to spot and examine problems efficiently on the app

* In the future, could we control the machines remotely through the app?
* In the future, could we simulate scenarios and see the results on the app?

## Challenges 

At this stage and positon, since I didn't have deep insight of these data and the relationship between video content and the data, I did my best guess and put together. More of deep understanding between data and the website would bring more creative and realistically possible ideas. 

Also, a bit rough insignt of the target users at this stage. More of deep research and observation in the site of them would bring more interesting insignt.
